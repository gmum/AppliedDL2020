This makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models, and it reduces boilerplate as well. To follow along with this guide, run the code samples below in an interactive python interpreter.\n","\n","Eager execution is a flexible machine learning platform for research and experimentation, providing:\n","\n","*    An intuitive interface—Structure your code naturally and use Python data structures. Quickly iterate on small models and small data.\n","*    Easier debugging—Call ops directly to inspect running models and test changes. Use standard Python debugging tools for immediate error reporting.\n","*    Natural control flow—Use Python control flow instead of graph control flow, simplifying the specification of dynamic models.\n","\n","Eager execution supports most TensorFlow operations and GPU acceleration.\n","\n","\\\\\n","\n","Enabling eager execution changes how TensorFlow operations behave — now they immediately evaluate and return their values to Python. tf.Tensor objects reference concrete values instead of symbolic handles to nodes in a computational graph. **Since there isn't a computational graph to build and run later in a session, it's easy to inspect results using print() or a debugger. Evaluating, printing, and checking tensor values does not break the flow for computing gradients.**\n","\n","Eager execution works nicely with NumPy. NumPy operations accept tf.Tensor arguments. TensorFlow math operations convert Python objects and NumPy arrays to tf.Tensor objects. The tf.Tensor.numpy method returns the object's value as a NumPy ndarray."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"k6FWT9mzKQUG","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"waJlrC0nKFNZ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ymQtAiqgKWpY","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["tf.enable_eager_execution()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"V7fnsWZpKaVm","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Check if using**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"l-X7g07YJT4y","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["tf.executing_eagerly() "],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y7RVFFr7Kjdh","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Examples**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yfhOeQAlKWsT","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["x = [[2.]]\n","m = tf.matmul(x, x)\n","print(\"hello, {}\".format(m)) # No need of using tf.Session!!"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"qmabbvnAKt_K","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["a = tf.constant([[1, 2],\n","                 [3, 4]])\n","print(a)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QNFmuK7NK3Uc","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Broadcasting support\n","b = tf.add(a, 1)\n","print(b)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_6OzDmy5K3X0","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Operator overloading is supported\n","print(a * b)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Dl-fWetqKuBt","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Use NumPy values!!\n","c = np.multiply(a, b)\n","print(c)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OaGSLDIiK-x1","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Obtain numpy value from a tensor:\n","print(a.numpy())"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nybk8pwzLIER","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**You can even write a tf FizzBuzz**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OcRNpZo7KuEH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def fizzbuzz(max_num):\n","    counter = tf.constant(0)\n","    max_num = tf.convert_to_tensor(max_num)\n","    for num in range(1, max_num.numpy()+1):\n","        num = tf.constant(num)\n","        if int(num % 3) == 0 and int(num % 5) == 0:\n","            print('FizzBuzz')\n","        elif int(num % 3) == 0:\n","            print('Fizz')\n","        elif int(num % 5) == 0:\n","            print('Buzz')\n","        else:\n","            print(num.numpy())\n","        counter += 1\n","        \n","fizzbuzz(24)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9fRpGC7aLyyL","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Computing gradients**\n","\n","During eager execution, use [tf.GradientTape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/GradientTape) to trace operations for computing gradients later."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"AlWARjMzLy5z","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["w = tf.Variable([[1.0]])\n","with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n","    loss = w * w\n","\n","grad = tape.gradient(loss, w)\n","print(grad)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Msg4__BEMgCC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Trainable variables are automatically watched.
